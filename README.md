# Is-string-a-substring-of-Permutation-of-another-string


Given two strings, the problem is to find whether one of the strings is a substring or equal to one of the permutations possible on the other string.

For example:

Below are some valid cases.
If the strings are "orange" and "genora" -- It is valid.
If the strings are "orange" and "gen" -- It is valid.
If the strings are "orange" and "g" -- It is valid.
If the strings are "orange" and "gorn" -- It is valid.
If the strings are "orange" and "gorna" -- It is valid.


Below are some invalid cases.
